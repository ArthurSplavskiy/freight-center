							<h2>The Best Way</h2>
							<p class="page-text">The best way to ship an engine is via <a href="#">(LTL) Less Than Truckload Freight</a>. In addition, partnering with a (3PL)
							third-party logistics provider takes all of the guesswork and stress out of LTL shipments. This method allows your
							engine to occupy only the necessary amount of space needed within an enclosed freight truck. This method also gets you
							involved with expert agents who know everything about the industry, inside and out. They shall be able to help with
							everything involved with planning your shipment.</p>
							<h2>LTL How to Ship an Engine</h2>
							<p class="page-text">LTL, like other Freight shipments, has requirements. With weights of 150-15K pounds, you only pay for the space your
							cargo occupies. This works very well for engine shipments. LTL also has multiple shipment options. You can ship via
							standard, expedited, or guaranteed services with them. Expedited is a rushed/time limited shipment. Guaranteed services,
							is guaranteeing delivery by a certain date. <a href="#">LTL freight</a> shipping can be complicated, FreightCenter however, can assist
							in those complications..</p>
							<h2>Consolidating Your Engine Shipment</h2>
							<p class="page-text">By consolidating your engine shipment with other shippers’ freight, you effectively “share the cost” of a full
							truckload. Because of this, shipping your engine via <a href="#">LTL</a> freight could cost as low as $100+, depending on weight,
							distance, and other factors. LTL also offers specialized services. These include expedited shipping, notification
							services, and guaranteed services, amongst many others. While there are always multiple options, for all kinds of
							shipments, <a href="#">LTL</a> is the best for shipments such as an engine. They can be <a href="#">shipped</a> in a crate or pallet.</p>
							<h2>Preparing Your Engine Shipment</h2>
							<p class="page-text">Now, whether or not you choose a crate or a pallet, you must drain all of the fluids from the engine. The fluid within
							is a potential danger, and the <a href="#">LTL</a> carrier shall not accept an engine that still has those within. Both methods have
							their unique <a href="#">classification</a> and rate table to determine the cost of the shipment. An engine on a pallet is class 85,
							while a crated engine’s class is 70. Pricing tends to be where the higher the class, the higher the cost. However,
							crating does take a lot less effort when it comes to the physical packaging, so the grass is not always greener on the
							other side.</p>
							<h2>Other Shipment Carriers?</h2>
							<p class="page-text">Are there other options for when you want to ship an engine? While there are technically other options, there are
							reasons why we only recommend LTL. The other freight carriers out there include full truckloads. The pros of these are
							that they have special equipment needs and tend to be the fastest option. However, you would need to pay for all of the
							space your shipment doesn’t take up and would be to discover limited trucks available for your type of item to ship.</p>
							<p class="page-text">Partial Truckload is the other. Shipments with these are essentially a fusion of LTL and full truck loads. You receive
							dedicated trucks that move smaller loads at a time, but again may have limited trucks available like the full truckload.
							These possibilities are due to them moving temperature or hazardous items that would make your engine shipment unsafe.
							Carriers such as these are best saved for other item types. The best engine shipment carriers shall remain LTL freights
							for the foreseeable future.</p>
							<h2>The Best Engine Shipment Carriers</h2>
							<p class="page-text">LTL has many carriers. Freight Center can help you find the best carrier for your specific shipments and destinations.
							Our network includes more than 50 of the top LTL carriers. This includes national and regional options. When searching
							through us, you’ll get instant access to dozens of rates from the top freight carriers.</p>
							<h2>FreightCenter</h2>
							<p class="page-text">FreightCenter has shipped thousands of engines over the past 20 years. Our team of experienced <a href="#">freight agents</a> can help
							you navigate the specifics of your engine shipment and help you ensure you cover all necessary steps. FreightCenter has
							been around since 1998 and has been a leading third-party logistics provider both around town and around the planet.
