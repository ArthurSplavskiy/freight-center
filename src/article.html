							<p>It is important to know how to properly send pallets to FBA. Following FBA guidelines will help ensure low costs. When
							you choose to use FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) services, you are handing over the shipping process to one of Amazon’s 75
							fulfillment centers. By using FBA, shippers can relax and have the peace of mind that their product(s) will arrive at
							their destinations in a safe and cost-effective manner. Providing details of your product will help you determine the
							right shipping methods. Doing this will allow you to pay the lowest cost according to Amazon’s current pricing
							structure. Amazon FBA has a very simple pricing structure. You pay $2.49 per unit for Amazon to store your product in
							their fulfillment centers, and they also handle all of the shipping and customer service for you. There is no monthly or
							annual fee, so you only pay when you make a sale. Additionally, you will need to make sure that you read all the fine
							print taking into account any potential additional fees.</p>
							<h2>Register to Ship with FBA</h2>
							<p>In order to do business with an FBA center, those wishing to ship will need to register for an account on the Amazon
							website. First, you will need to provide the name and contact info for your business. Next, you will add other important
							info like payment details, address and phone number and answer any personal identity questions. Once Amazon has this
							info, they will need to learn a little more about what you’re selling. If you want to ship pallets to FBA, you have to
							set up your product listings to be eligible. This means that your products have to meet Amazon’s standards for
							packaging, labeling, and barcodes, and you will need to provide product details. FBA will take care of all of those
							things for you, but it costs a little more.</p>

							<h2>Shipping Methods</h2>
							<p>When you are ready to ship your items on a pallet to FBA, there are multiple modes of transport to consider. For
							example, when shipping a large number of items, it may be best to use Full Truckload shipping. Use Full Truck load
							shipping when you have a large sum of items that will use the entire truck’s space. With smaller quantities, it’s best
							to use LTL, or Less Than Truckload shipping. LTL shipping means your load will ride alongside others on a truck with
							multiple destinations.</p>
							<h2>How to Send Pallets to FBA: Packaging</h2>
							<p>After choosing the right shipping method for you, it is time to assemble your shipment onto the pallet bound for FBA.
							Place items in the middle of the pallet with the heaviest units on the bottom. If possible, do not place more than three
							units high. Stacks of pallets can be no taller than 16 feet, including the height of the pallet. Check items for proper
							packaging once bound to the pallet. When shipping pallets, it is important to securely fasten your items with plastic.
							If you are using your own packaging, be sure to include the weight and dimensions of your shipment on the label. If you
							are unsure about how to properly stage your boxes on a pallet, please consult with a shipping professional. Improperly
							staged boxes can result in delays and fees for the shipper.</p>

							<h2>FBA Pallet Guidelines</h2>
							<p>When sending pallets to FBA, shippers must follow Amazon’s standard guidelines. This includes confirming all items fit
							on the pallet and meet the weight requirements (minimum 150 lbs, max 1,500 lbs). All shipments must be properly labeled
							with a unique identifier called an ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number). You can find this number on every
							product detail page on Amazon. Place labels on the outside of the protective plastic, covering all four sides. Place
							labels squarely, in an upright position and ensure they are readable for pickup. For pallets containing one ASIN, labels
							should read “Single ASIN Pallet.” When using a pallet, all boxes on that pallet must have the same shipment ID. Each box
							on the pallet will require its own unique FBA shipment ID label. You cannot copy, reuse or modify labels for use on
							another box.</p>
							<h2>Bill of Lading</h2>
							<p>Each LTL/FT shipment requires a valid bill of lading. A bill of lading is standard paperwork that provides the customer,
							carrier and driver with important information. This information includes shipping costs and transportation information
							for the freight. Shipments partnered with Amazon will be given their BOLs on the morning of pickup.</p>

							<h2>Final Steps</h2>
							<p>Once you’ve completed the previous steps, you’re ready to ship your pallets to FBA. Planning and preparation are
							important steps in the process of any form of shipping. Shippers should schedule their shipment’s delivery in advance.
							Knowledgeable scheduling can help shippers avoid delays. By following Amazon’s step-by-step shipping guidelines, all
							parties involved can complete a successful shipping process. If you’re shipping to Amazon FBA, there are a few things
							you need to keep in mind. Due to Amazon’s strict guidelines, all rules will be followed in order to avoid delays,
							rejections, or future bans on shipments. You should become familiar with all of the necessary steps and requirements
							before starting the shipping process.</p>
